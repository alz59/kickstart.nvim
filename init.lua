-- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.
--
-- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
-- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
--
-- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
--  event = 'VimEnter'
--
-- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
-- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
--
-- Then, because we use the `config` key, the configuration only runs
-- after the plugin has been loaded:
--  config = function() ... end
-- The following two comments only work if you have downloaded the kickstart repo, not just copy pasted the
-- init.lua. If you want these files, they are in the repository, so you can just download them and
-- place them in the correct locations.

-- NOTE: The import below can automatically add your own plugins, configuration, etc from `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua`
--    This is the easiest way to modularize your config.
--
--  Uncomment the following line and add your plugins to `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua` to get going.
--    For additional information, see `:help lazy.nvim-lazy.nvim-structuring-your-plugins`
-- { import = 'custom.plugins' }
-- The line beneath this is called `modeline`. See `:help modeline`
